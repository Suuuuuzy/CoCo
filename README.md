CoCo
=======

CoCo is a tool that utilizes Coverage-guided,
Concurrent Abstract Interpretation to analyze JavaScript code, specifically, browser extension code, to find vulnerabilities.

Please refer to the paper for details. 

[CoCo: Efficient Browser Extension Vulnerability Detection via Coverage-guided, Concurrent Abstract Interpretation](https://yinzhicao.org/CoCo/CoCo.pdf)

<span style="font-size:24px;">üèÜ</span> CoCo won the **Distinguished Paper Award** of CCS 2023.

## Installation
CoCo requires Python 3.7+ and Node.js 12+. To set up the environment, run `./install.sh`.

## Command line arguments
Use the following arugments to run the tool:

```bash
./single_run.sh [input_file] 
```

`input_file` is the path to the extension source code directory.


## Examples
We provide some examples in the `demos/` directory. To run, simply:
```shell
$ ./single_run.sh demos/exec_code
```

You can also try to edit your own code to test, just modify the content in `demos/test` and run
```shell
$ ./single_run.sh demos/test
```

## Results
Results are stored in `extension_dir/opgen_generated_files/used_time.txt`
