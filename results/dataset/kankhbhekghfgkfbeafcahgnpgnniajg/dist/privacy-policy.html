                        <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
                        <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                            modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out
                            using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
                            strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
                            Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
                            abcdpdf.com (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration)
                            or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting
                            providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
                            Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner
                            at any time.</p>
                        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                        <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                                legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                                such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
                                following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                                Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or
                                for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                                subject;</li>
                            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                                exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                                Owner or by a third party.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
                            the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                            contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
                        <h3>Place</h3>
                        <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the
                            parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br> Depending on the User's location,
                            data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own.
                            To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the
                            section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                        <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside
                            the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law
                            or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by
                            the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br><br> If any such transfer takes place, Users can find
                            out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using
                            the information provided in the contact section.</p>
                        <h3>Retention time</h3>
                        <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
                            been collected for.</p>
                        <p>Therefore:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between
                                the Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
                            </li>
                            <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be
                                retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                                regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of
                                this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has
                            given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the
                            Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
                            for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br> Once the
                            retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access,
                            the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
                            enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>
